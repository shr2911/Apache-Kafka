What Is Apache Kafka?
Distributed Event Streaming Platform: Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data streams in real time.

Use Cases: Ideal for building real-time data pipelines, event-driven architectures, and stream processing applications.

üèóÔ∏è Kafka Architecture Overview
1. Producer
Role: Sends data (events/messages) to Kafka topics.

Behavior: Producers can choose which partition within a topic to send messages to, often using a key-based partitioning strategy.

2. Broker
Role: A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients.

Cluster Formation: Multiple brokers form a Kafka cluster, distributing data across them for scalability and fault tolerance.

3. Topic
Definition: A category or feed name to which records are sent by producers.

Characteristics:

Immutable Logs: Once data is written, it cannot be modified.

Partitioned: Topics are split into partitions, allowing parallel processing.

4. Partition
Purpose: Enables Kafka to horizontally scale by distributing data across multiple brokers.

Replication: Each partition can have multiple replicas across brokers to ensure data durability and availability.

5. Consumer
Role: Reads data from Kafka topics.

Consumer Groups: Multiple consumers can form a group to share the consumption of topic partitions, allowing for load balancing and fault tolerance.

6. ZooKeeper (Deprecated in newer versions)
Function: Manages and coordinates Kafka brokers, handling tasks like leader election and metadata management.

Note: Kafka is transitioning to a new architecture called KRaft (Kafka Raft Metadata Mode), which eliminates the need for ZooKeeper.

üîÑ Data Flow in Kafka
Producer sends messages to a Topic.

Messages are stored in Partitions within the topic.

Consumers read messages from these partitions, either individually or as part of a Consumer Group.

‚úÖ Key Features of Kafka
High Throughput: Capable of handling millions of messages per second.

Scalability: Easily scales horizontally by adding more brokers.

Durability: Ensures data is replicated and fault-tolerant.

Real-Time Processing: Supports real-time data streaming and processing.

üß© Kafka Ecosystem Components
Kafka Streams: A client library for building applications and microservices where the input and output data are stored in Kafka topics.

Kafka Connect: A tool for scalably and reliably streaming data between Kafka and other systems.
